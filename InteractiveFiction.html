		    <h2>The Life of Justin</h2>
		 <h3> Cash Galloway & Leonardo Barrera </h3>
		 <h6> Storytime with Justin Landfried : Once upon a time, there was a highschool student in New York, New York City that was muscular and was known as the coolest kid on campus. In the 1980’s, nearly every kid had such a retro style to their dressing and traveled around town in classic cars or bikes. This jock had it all, however, this student didn’t have a clear direction of where his future will head in terms of his future profession. Justin Landfried needed a wake up call from this spiraling problem before this takes control of his life. This made Justin desperately go around out of class to seek help on finding solutions everyday for weeks on out by asking people from school. Unfortunately, Justin couldn’t seek the help he needed so he went to his local library in hope of finding any kind of solution to his nightmare. Desperately, he arrived at Central Library and began asking everyone there. Yet, only a select amount of people there which meant his chances of finding the answer was slim. So Justin asked everyone and couldn’t find an answer, but had one last person before he leaves. It was this strange-looking lady that was a librarian that looked like to a witch. She smelled foul like sewage and had long-damaged gray hair. She was known as Miss Evanora and never held conversations among anyone, but a select few who were like herself. Hopelessly, Justin asked Evanora about his future and left with shock from the answer he finally received along with this blank book. It sounded imaginary, but Justin had to try. There was this island made completely of computers and had knowledge among many gods. For instance, Bill Gates and Steve Jobs are worshipped as the true gods of this magical island called “I-Land” where knowledge was unobtainable through Earth. The only way to get to I-Land made Justin first cut his hand and place it on this book that Evanora handed to him. Then, Justin must light this book on fire which would suddenly open this portal to I-Land. As instructed, Justin thought this wouldn’t work yet he attempted it anyways. When Justin got home, he went into his garage along with a knife and lighter and followed the steps. He cut his hand brutally, but was desperate and placed it on the book, Justin closed it and was about to ignite this book. Right as he ignited it, the whole thing burst rapidly into flames forcing Justin to drop it where this purple electric portal began opening. Justin was shocked and began freaking out as this loud, growing portal began pulling him into it. Justin was trying to run away from it, but he suddenly passed out as the portal forced him into it. Randomly, Justin awoke with this sharp pain in his head but had his breath taken away when he looked around. Justin realized he was no longer on Earth, but now on I-Land where “people” were just normal human bodies yet had computer monitors as their heads. Justin sat on the floor just in awe to admire this magical island where, as described, was entirely made of computers where the center was this gargantuan temple where many people were entering and exiting. Then, this person walked to Justin and took him by the hand and lead Justin to the temple. Justin arrived to the temple, He was introduced to Bill Gates where the plan of finding his future was all a simple process that would take a year and would return to Earth. Justin had to be modified slightly to become part machine and part human in order to do the following process of obtaining the knowledge from I-Land that derived from Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. So then Justin did the following and was prepped for the final process. Justin had to be plugged into this router which makes him unconscious for an entire year in order to absorb all the information. Justin agreed to this so as a year passed by, he awoke half cyborg and half human with knowledge of a god for computers. Bill and Steve shook Justin’s hand as he was prepared to returned back to Earth. They threw a ball on the floor and it exploded a pink portal this time where Justin only was getting pulled to it. Justin again went unconscious and woke back up with a pain in his head to realize he was back on Earth. He looked around with a big smile and now had the future of his life ahead of him ready to follow. So as his life went on, Justin found peace to be a teacher where he teaches students basic fundamental abilities to computer science. After school, he would practice his mastery of his knowledge with reading 10 books about computers a night. THE END.</h6>
	<h7> Write Up: Throughout the short time interval of this project, I learned the very basic fundamental to coding in python as to making a story driven game where inputs as simple as typing one letter and pressing enter allows users to progress through my game. I had experienced difficulty with two things among this the project. First, I had the entire story and events laid down in order, but python would not function at all due to a syntax error that I could not figure out for a few class days so I had to locate it by reading the critical failure notes and locating all of the 6 locations and reworking each part until it functioned normally. Second I had trouble getting to loop my story to start at the beginning when the player either dies or wants input answers that were not available so I had to create many separate functions for almost every chunk of the storyline in order to allow a restart function to do this. I had fun with this and got to say I made my first "game" coding in python!</h7>
