		 <h3> WRITEUP FOR VIDEO: This video displays the operation of our programmed quiz. You will be asked a series of question attached to the choices available for each. If your answer is correct then you will move on to the next question, but if it’s incomplete then you will be asked to answer again. This will be done for 10 question until you get the message “good job! The quiz  is officially over. </h3>

		 <h6> WRITEUP FOR RSA PROJECT: After completing our message encryptor/decryptor, I can say there were issues that arose that were resolved. For instance, one issue of mine with this coding was creating the encryptor as I had mistakenly took Mr. Landfried’s restrictions of not being able to use his code to encrypt messages. The mistake here was that I took these restrictions too far on myself by deleting all my math functions that were fundamental to creating and coding an encryptor. I resolved this issue after trying to push through the next few class days and ended up resorting to classmates for assistance where they helped me realize that to even make the encryptor that I MUST use those deleted functions so I added them back and slowly ended up finding light of completing our encryptor. Another issue that arose during the development of our coding was creating the while loop that allowed users to select options. We knew how to start a while loop but not how to break one when needed to stop. Our code would run non-stop until the user forced paused the program or closed the tab corresponding to the running code. We resolved this issue by deciding to end the while loop by setting ‘x’ to false instead of typing “break” at the end of the loop. One point of the development process that I completed independently was our encryptor. I put many many class periods to solely focus on finishing this part of the code in order to push for some progress in our RSA messages where we had many messages that needed to be sent urgently. </h6>
