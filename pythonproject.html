		    <h2>General Knowledge of the United States Quiz by Cash Galloway and Jesse Courtney</h2>
		 <h3> WRITEUP FOR VIDEO: This video displays the operation of our programmed quiz. You will be asked a series of question attached to the choices available for each. If your answer is correct then you will move on to the next question, but if it’s incomplete then you will be asked to answer again. This will be done for 10 question until you get the message “good job! The quiz  is officially over. </h3>

		 <h6> WRITEUP FOR PYTHON PROJECT: Through the many frustrating hours put into this quiz, we come to final product of the General Knowledge of the United States Quiz. First of all, the quiz is like any normal quiz where running the quiz prompts the user with questions and will not progress until the user guesses the correct answer. An issue that arose was getting the while loop to properly function as users guess options outside of the given four choices. The while loop would bugged out the entire quiz by spamming "please select an option" nonstop thus ruining the entire function quiz. We fixed this by easily changing a simple typo of using the user's input by using "raw" (which ruined the quiz) and replaced it with "raw_input" to fix the entire code. A second issue of the quiz is that the questions would not transition among each other as the quiz would end after one question. We repaired this by separating the questions into nearly their own function which allowed users to do the entire quiz. A thing I did myself was code this entire quiz with my hands as my partner assisted me verbally. </h6>
