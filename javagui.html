		    <h2>Tic-Tac-Toe by Cash Galloway and Jack Trudeau</h2>
		 <h3> WRITEUP: For our Java GUI, we came up with our coded Tic-Tac-Toe game! The game runs with the player ‘x’ starting first where two players play to get their symbol in a line of three wether this is done vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. However, this was made through a process of trial and error where we overcame numerous issues. For instance, an issue that arose was getting the game to restart after an outcome was presented like someone winning or comes out a draw. We overcame this by deciding to code a reset function instead of leaving “System.exit(0);” resolving this issue entirely. Another issue was finding a way to display the current user’s turn. So we coded a function that specifically displayed the current turn on the title of the GUI as this is only solution we can discover that worked. A piece of the game I coded independently was the whole button layout and their ability to change colors marking who claimed the button either being ‘x’s or ‘o’s decision on their turn.</h3>
